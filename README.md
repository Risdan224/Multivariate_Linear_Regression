Multivariate Linear Regression to Predict Medical Payout Charges

Multivariate regression is a machine learning algorithm that is used to predict a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. It is an extension of simple linear regression, which only uses one independent variable. Multivariate regression can be used to model more complex relationships between variables, and it is often used in fields such as finance, economics, and marketing.

In this project, I apply a multivariate linear model to predict medical insurance payout. The dataset is produced by Jovian for the machine learning study program.
